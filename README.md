## COURSE INFORMATION

### Description
This is an introductory course in computation within context of media and art with a focus on two-dimensional graphics. The potential of computer as medium will be considered through **exercises**, **assignments**, **readings**, and **critiques**. Both procedural and object-oriented programming will be explored, as well as, using input and output of files, generative techniques, and image creation through data processing.

### Learning Outcomes
- Apply critical thinking in writing and oral presentation skills
- Analyze the social and cultural importance of computational media art
- Use technical proficiency to create computational media art
- Create a two-dimensional computational-based project



### Special project

What would it mean to de-colonize code and a programming language?

| 6     | 10/04       | Auto-generator              | Ch 05        | Give yourself sometime to read and tinker with the code, as well as to observe the different stages of Langton’s Ant.   The Langton’s Ant program represents the world of an ant through abstraction, and sets limits on cell color, movement and direction. Rethink the rules that have been implemented. Try changing the existing rules or adding new rules so that the ant behaves differently? (Recall what you have changed in the previous exercise with 10 PRINT.)   In simulating living systems — such as the complex behavior of insects — there seems to be a focus on process over outcome. Let’s discuss the following questions:   Can you think of, and describe, other systems and processes that exhibit emergent behavior?   How would you understand autonomy in this context?[29](https://aesthetic-programming.net/pages/5-auto-generator.html#fn:Watz) To what extent do you consider the machine to be an active agent in generative systems?

Discussion in groups:     Identify a game you are familiar with, and describe the characters/objects using the class, and object concepts, and vocabulary. Can you identify the classes and objects within the chosen example?   Given that the creation of objects requires the concept of abstraction, and in line with some of the introductory ideas for this chapter; can you use the sample code or your game as an example to think through some of the political implications of class/object abstraction? How do objects interact with the world, and how do worldviews and ideologies built into objects’ properties and behaviors? Does the fact that this is a game allow for further reflection on the way everyday activities (such as enjoying tofu) become object-oriented? | Matthew  Fuller and Andrew Goffey, "[The Obscure Objects of  Object Orientation](pdfs/The-Obscure-Objects-of-Object-Orientation_Fuller+Goffey.pdf)," in Matthew Fuller, How to be a Geek: Essays on the  Culture of Software (Cambridge: Polity, 2017).

How would you understand autonomy in this context?[29](https://aesthetic-programming.net/pages/5-auto-generator.html#fn:Watz) To what extent do you consider the machine to be an active agent in generative systems?

Discussion in groups:     Identify a game you are familiar with, and describe the characters/objects using the class, and object concepts, and vocabulary. Can you identify the classes and objects within the chosen example?   Given that the creation of objects requires the concept of abstraction, and in line with some of the introductory ideas for this chapter; can you use the sample code or your game as an example to think through some of the political implications of class/object abstraction? How do objects interact with the world, and how do worldviews and ideologies built into objects’ properties and behaviors? Does the fact that this is a game allow for further reflection on the way everyday activities (such as enjoying tofu) become object-oriented? | Matthew  Fuller and Andrew Goffey, "The Obscure Objects of  Object Orientation," in Matthew Fuller, How to be a Geek: Essays on the  Culture of Software (Cambridge: Polity, 2017).
