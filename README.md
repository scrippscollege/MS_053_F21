## COURSE INFORMATION

### Description
This is an introductory course in computation within context of media and art with a focus on two-dimensional graphics. The potential of computer as medium will be considered through **exercises**, **assignments**, **readings**, and **critiques**. Both procedural and object-oriented programming will be explored, as well as, using input and output of files, generative techniques, and image creation through data processing.

### Learning Outcomes
- Apply critical thinking in writing and oral presentation skills
- Analyze the social and cultural importance of computational media art
- Use technical proficiency to create computational media art
- Create a two-dimensional computational-based project

## Required Instructional Materials

### **Python for Everybody**, Charles R. Severance

Book, website, creator of Sakai, Open Source hero. His book will supplies our foundation for learning Python 3. You don't need the book because *it is your class.*

### [P4E.com](https://www.py4e.com/login) account

The free web site for Python for Everybody. This site hosts half of the assessments for the class.

### [Free GitHub account](https://github.com), https://github.com

An online development platform. Our syllabus lives on GitHub. Essential.

### Free [Replit account](https://replit.com), https://replit.com

Replit is a collaborative, in-browser IDE. Authenticate with your GitHub credentials.

### Special project

What would it mean to de-colonize code and a programming language?

## Recommended Material

### *Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers*, Ben Fry and Casey Reas

### *The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood*, James Gleick

### *The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization* Alberto Cairo

## Assessment

### 40% P4E

### 40% Final project (proposal and completion)

### 20% Attendance + Participation

### Final Project Grading is based on the following factors:

1. Perseverance
2. Faithfulness to the proposal
3. Creative engagement
4. Application of critical thinking
5. Preparation (research, accumulation of needed materials, time management)
6. Success of the finished piece

## Course and Institutional Policies

#### **COVID-19 Policies**:

Please wear your masks during class. Please consult https://www.scrippscollege.edu/scripps-strong/return-to-campus-plan/ for the latest information.

#### Attendance Policy:

You may miss up to four classes and still pass this class. Note that 60 percent of the students' grade is given for work on in-class activities, and that these cannot be repeated except in extraordinary circumstances.

#### Participation Policy:

You are expected to be attentive, ask questions, work alone and with a partner to complete your work.

#### Late Assignment and Missed Exam Policy:

Labs and in-class activities will not be repeated except in extraordinary circumstances.

#### Academic Integrity:
 Students are expected to abide by the Scripps College academic integrity code. You must submit work that is your own and which is original work for this class. Also, all sources must be documented. Omission of sources is considered plagiarism, even if it is an oversight and/or unintentional. All plagiarism will be reported to the department and Dean’s office for further action. For this course, collaboration is allowed in on lab activities and assignments IFF all contributions are documented.

Permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in any form (e.g. email, Word doc, Box file, Google sheet, or a hard copy). Also, assignments that have been previously submitted in another course may not be submitted for this course, and I discourage you from finding solutions on Stack Overflow or other online forums to paste into your notebooks.

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

 Scripps students seeking to register to receive academic accommodations must contact Academic Resources and Services Staff (ARS) at ars@scrippscollege.edu to formalize accommodations. Students will be required to submit documentation and meet with a staff member before being approved for accommodations. Once ARS has authorized academic accommodations, a formal notification will be sent out.

A student’s home campus is responsible for establishing and providing accommodations. If you are not a Scripps student, you must contact your home institution to establish accommodations. Below is a list of coordinators on the other campuses:

CMC - Julia Easley, julia.easley@claremontmckenna.edu

Harvey Mudd – Deborah Kahn, dkahn@hmc.edu

Pitzer- Gabriella Tempestoso, gabriella_tempestoso@pitzer.edu

Pomona - Jan Collins-Eaglin, Jan.Collins-Eaglin@pomona.edu



#### Inclusivity Statement:
 This class is an example of Scripps College’s commitment to changing the norms in Computer Science. Creating this initiative at a liberal arts women's college is both a bold step towards correcting gender imbalance in this field.

Our community represents a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives. We are committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity.   



#### Institutional Policies:
 Students are responsible for reviewing Scripps College’s policies on incomplete grades, sexual misconduct, adverse weather, as well as student evaluation of instruction, and days of special concern/religious holiday.
