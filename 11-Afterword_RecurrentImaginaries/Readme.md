Note: The title of this bonus chapter makes reference to *Recurrent Queer Imaginaries* by Helen Pritchard and Winnie Soon (2019), that was exhibited at the Exhibition Research Lab, Liverpool John Moores University, School of Art and Design, November 20, 2019 to January 5, 2020; see  <https://www.exhibition-research-lab.co.uk/exhibitions/recurrent-queer-imaginaries/>. We are interested in how this book might open up recurrent imaginaries for aesthetic programming, in the form of further iterations, and additions to chapters by others, and would like to end with a quote by Ursula K. Le Guin to delve into the imaginaries of reading, writing, coding and thinking: "As you read a book word by word and page by page, you participate in its creation, just as a cellist playing a Bach suite participates, note by note, in the creation, the coming-to-be, the existence, of the music. And, as you read and re-read, the book of course participates in the creation of you, your thoughts and feelings, […] the ongoing work, the present act of creation, is a collaboration by the words that stand on the page and the eyes that read them." Ursula K. Le Guin, "Books Remembered," *Calendar* XXXVI, no.2 (November 1977-June 1978), np.
