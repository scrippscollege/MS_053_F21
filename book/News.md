# Known issues

* Chapter 4 sample code with the mic/sound issue: getLevel() :
  - The sample code in chapter 4 needs to run directly on GitLab with the lower version of the p5 libraries - [here](https://aesthetic-programming.gitlab.io/book/). (The web version sketch is now using the latest libraries-2022-by default) See the relevant open issue [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound/issues/499). The sketch with the latest library can run on Firefox ESR, Mac Google Chrome but just not on Firefox ver 96.
* There is a bug in which hyperlink ends with '/' cannot be processed in both miniX and project lists, etc.
