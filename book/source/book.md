"Instructive, imaginative and accessible, this is an introduction to programming like no other. Aesthetic Programming opens up the thinking in software in a vivid, critical and creative manner; it is a book full of procedural pleasures and witty algorithms that also poses a remarkable set of questions about contemporary digital life." 

—  Matthew Fuller, Professor of Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths, University of London

"Skilfully moving across the instructional, the pedagogic, and the critical, Aesthetic Programming makes an expansive contribution to computational thinking. Engaging with programming from a practice-based approach, this illuminating text demonstrates how critical aesthetics can transform programming. Recipe book, code library, poetic manual, convivial instructional, and primer to computing imaginaries all assemble into this compelling and indispensable addition to software studies."

— Jennifer Gabrys, Chair in Media, Culture and Environment, University of Cambridge
