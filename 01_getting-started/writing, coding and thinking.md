## Demonstration Plot from show May 11 - June 6, 1971

>  I drew at the opening and every afternoon from 3-5pm with a Benson flatbed plotter demonstrating to the public how an automatic drawing machine works. I worked of course **offline** - the information was preregistered on a magnetic tape - because at that time the technology did not yet allow me to work **online**, since a computer had to operate in an air conditioned environment and could not be transported to the museum.
